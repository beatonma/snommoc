# Features

Like `components`, `features` are reusable building blocks.

Unlike `components`, `features` depend on specific data structures which are not typical React-based properties - typically derived from an API or framework structure.

A `feature` may be a complex UI widget - or even an entire page - composed of `components` and/or other `features`, or it may be a simple adapter for showing a data value in a standard way. The common factor is that they are data-driven chunks of UI.
