This project started as an attempt to make UK politics more engaging. It uses [UK parliament data](https://developer.parliament.uk/) and displays it in readable, searchable, hopefully useful formats.

Somewhere along the way I realised that I don't have solid vision of what my goals for this project really are. I still work on it from time to time, but it has become primarily a learning playground and, hopefully, a portfolio piece. A 'serious' project I can point to, among my many more frivolous projects.

A demo version of the project is live at [commons.beatonma.org](https://commons.beatonma.org). In this demo mode the site is essentially static - user accounts are disabled and data is not scheduled for updates - but it should give you a flavour of what it's supposed to be.
