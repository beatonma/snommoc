A personal project, originally intended as a product to make UK politics more engaging. Now
primarily just a sample app and tech playground.

It started out as a standalone Android client for browsing parliamentary data - something like a
basic [TheyWorkForYou](https://theyworkforyou.com) - but over time I implemented a proper
Django-based backend. I wanted to make it more 'sticky', with reasons to use the app regularly, 
so I started adding social features, allowing users to vote and comment on bills and divisions and 
even MPs and Lords.

I went quite far down that road before realising I wanted nothing to do with the result: administering something that was quickly turning into a politics-focused social network sounded like hell.

I abandoned the idea of ever actually releasing it, but I still work on it from time
to time because it's a 'serious' data-based project which maybe has a decent idea hidden somewhere
inside it and I might just figure out what that is some day. If nothing else it gives me an excuse
to explore technologies and challenges that I would never normally have reason to bother with.

You can read [a bit more about it here](https://beatonma.org/apps/org-beatonma-commons/)
if you like. A basic demo webapp (without accounts or social features) can be found
at [commons.beatonma.org](https://commons.beatonma.org). The repository for the Android app can be 
found [here](https://github.com/beatonma/commons).
